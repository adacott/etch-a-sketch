This is the odin etch-a-sketch project. This demonstrates intermediate use of CSS, html,
and javscript. The javscript was used for eventListeners and triggering functions, and the CSS
and HTML provided the appearance and organization of the page.

The github pages may look bad -- I dont know if its because it hasn't deployed my latest push from local or not, but if tested in a browser on the local machine, it looks as it is supposed to.
